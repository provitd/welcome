It is data that you cannot regenerate (or not easily), and that should never be modified. The type of files can vary, but a good exemple for sequencing technologies is .fastq files.\nSometimes, the sequencing platform will also give you some pre- or fully analyzed data. An example in the case of single-cell RNA-seq is cell-by-gene matrices. If it is the basis of your analysis, you should consider them just like raw data.\nThese files are required to publish.",

    "text": "2.3 Steps to save raw data\nSo here are the general steps on how to correctly save raw data:\n\nDownload the data and store them securely: Save them on a mendel space or a backed-up institutional storage. Do not save your data only on your local computer, if it is broken, lost, or stolen, the data will be lost forever.\nVerify its integrity: Along with your data, you should have a way to verify the data was not corrupted during its download. For example, you might be given the md5 of files. You must always keep the file containing the original md5 values together with the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA md5 is 32-character fingerprint of the file. If the file is not exactly the same as the original one, recomputing the md5 will give a different result and you will know that your file was corrupted (i.e. modified, truncated…).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn R, you can for example run tools::md5sum(\"/path/to/file\") to get the md5 of a file.\n\n\n\nDo not touch it anymore: Make the files only readable. You can go to the Properties of a file and set its permission to Read only. Or using command line, you can restrain the modification of a folder with chmod -r 444 /path/to/folder. This also includes not changing the name of the files! If you need to put some data in another folder, or with another name, you can create symbolic links with ln -s in bash, or a shortcut file.",

Metadata is data about data. It gives a description and a context about the data. It can be the species, tissue type or conditions of the samples, as well as the lab protocol, sequencing technology etc…\nIf you filled GenomEast’s LIMS correctly, you already have some of that information. You can save the project page of the study as a pdf and put it in the folder that contains the data. It contains general information about the study (ID, title, technology, date, collaborators, aim, description of samples…). You can also fill and export the table of the Samples conditions in .csv format.\nA metadata file for your samples can be in a excel, .csv, .tsv, .txt format, or any format that can be easily exploited in further analysis in a programming language. What is important that:\n\neach samples have a unique identifier\none variable corresponds to one column\nhave consistant values inside of the column\n\nFor example:\n,Condition_treatment\nSample1,Control_6\nSample2,TreatmentA_6\nSample3,TreatmentB_6\nSample4,ctrl_9\nSample5,TreatmentA_6\nSample6,TreatmentB_6\nis bad!

    "text": "3.3 Analysis\nIn the analysis/ folder, the general rule is to have one folder per subanalysis. The subanalysis folder is named with the date and a general title (e.g. 200301_scRNA/). You can create as many subanalysis and subfolders as necessary (e.g. 200301_scRNA/200301_preprocessing/). In each subanalysis folder, there is one script, most likely a quarto document .qmd that creates an easily readable report in .html. Any result created by this script is present in the same folder. If many results are created, organise them into folders (e.g. rds/ for saving R objects, figure/ for saving plots, table/ for saving tables etc.).\nThink about the architecture of your folder before starting your analysis. For this you need to break down your general idea of the analysis into smaller chunks. Are you going to analysis one or several datasets (and so, create one folder per dataset)? What are the planned steps of your analysis (and so, create one folder per step for a given dataset)? Of course, you might not know all of the analyses you will do in advance, but you will get an idea of the level of complexity of the architecture of folders to create.\nThis is important as it is not a good practice to move and rename folders or files. Some scripts depend on the results of previous analyses, so moving and renaming folders or files can create discrepencies in other analyses.",
