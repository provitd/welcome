Working with R Projects is a good practice when analysing in R. It provides a structured and efficient way to manage your R scripts, data, and results files, ensuring that your analysis is reproducible, organized, and easy to share.

Here are the key reasons why you should always use R Projects:

- Better organization: All related files (scripts, raw data, results, documentation) are stored in one single folder. This prevents confusion and makes it easy to navigate your work.

- Automatic setting of working directory: R Projects automatically set the working directory to your project folder every time you open it. This means your file paths will work consistently, avoiding frustrating “file not found” errors.

- Easier collaboration: When sharing a project folder, collaborators get all the files and can run your analysis without reconfiguring file paths.

- Compatibility with best practices as R Projects integrate smoothly with:
  - Git for version control, which tracks changes, allows you to roll back to earlier versions, and collaborate effectively.
  - renv for package management, which records the exact package versions used so your project can be reproduced exactly in the future or on another computer.
